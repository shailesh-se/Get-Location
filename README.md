# Get-Location

Location-Based Web Service with Anonymous Data Collection

This project is a simple web application that anonymously collects users' location data when they access the site. Built with Python (Flask) for the backend and a user-friendly HTML interface on the frontend, the application prompts users to enter the website, gathers their geolocation (with their consent), and sends the data to the backend server for processing.

The project demonstrates how to handle geolocation requests in a seamless manner using JavaScript's Geolocation API and integrate it with a Python backend for data storage or further processing. It also features cache-busting techniques to ensure the latest version of the site is always loaded, providing an efficient, secure, and privacy-compliant solution for gathering location data.
